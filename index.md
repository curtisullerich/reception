# Meishan and Curtis are getting married!

and we're planning a party at the farm! We would love if you could join us for a
reception to celebrate our marriage.

---

Curtis has a family reunion in Atlantic on July 12-13. We decided to have a
reception for our family and Iowa loved ones while all the Ohms/Ullerich crew
would be in the same location already, rather than asking everyone to travel
again. Emily and Nathan generously offered to host us at their farm near Elk
Horn. We'll have dinner, yards games, board games, conversation, and maybe a
campfire by the end of the night. Please arrive any time that is convenient for
you. We'll have dinner ready around 5, and keep it warm and ready for a couple
hours, no coordinated seating time or formalities.  

Please [RSVP]({{ site.baseurl }}/rsvp) so we know how much food to make.
